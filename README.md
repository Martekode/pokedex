## The creatures of the forbidden land
Long ago there ws a forbidden land named Kanto full of majestical creatures with special powers. This land is long lost and forgotten by most.
Our hero, in contrary to the rest of the world, hopes to reignite the torch of knowledge and sets out to a dangerous mission. The task ahead will require the hero to find that forgotten land and log these creatures. Making a display for everyone to see is the end goal. so nobody can ever dispute the existance of this "wanderfull" world. (yes i meen WANDERfull, because we'll wander into uncharted territory).


## The Place to Show
Our hero's first steps were heavy sinds he found clues very quickly but ran in to troubles equally. He found data of the creatures but could get it out of the data retreiever. After searching for too long our hero decided to just do the task as was required of him and began his plan.
 First he set out the places to display everything. He gave them propper names to define where to put everything later. A box to let people interface with what they wanted to find. Because if they coould search themself for the creatures then the people couldn't say he faked it. After the markup he went on to find the creatures. 

## The first Pocket Monster
After doing the skeleton work for the display and querry interface he started to actually search for the creatures. He used a method at first that woul let the users search by name. But that gave too few results (only 20). But then he found a way to do it by id and got 1126 results. "So many.." he gasped. the hero than quickly made it so that the name would appear. Mission success... But now for the depiction of the creature itself. That was harder because it didn't give an img of the creature. But it gave another clue inside... He then searched for that clue and got what he wanted. Here the images were stored and by some quick selections knew which one he needed the front_default. And now that displays too. the users are going to be happy.
