Our hero, in contrary to the rest of the world, hopes to reignite the torch of knowledge and sets out to a dangerous mission. The task ahead will require the hero to find that forgotten land and log these creatures. Making a display for everyone to see is the end goal. so nobody can ever dispute the existance of this "wanderfull" world. (yes i meen WANDERfull, because we'll wander into uncharted territory).
